# Prusa Alternative Firmware
### Currently tracking: 3.8.1 commit 2869
**This is a work in progress.  The most recent release is always the firmware I am using on my own printer.**





## What is this?

***This project grew out of my own fairly modest tinkering of the stock Prusa MK3 firmware.  This firmware is by no means 'better' than Prusa Research's own stock firmware, nor will the average user gain any benefit from using it.***  

If you want greater control over some of the more advanced and low level features of your printer, or would like a more generalized firmware with certain hardcoded, prusa MK3 specific values changed so as not to be hardcoded (great if you have a non-standard printer configuration), then it might be worth your time to take a look at this firmware.  

A quick example of what I mean:  The stock firmware's XYZ Calibration does not respect the `#define INVERT_<X,Y,Z or E>_AXIS <...>` lines in `1_75mm_MK3_EINSy10a-E3Dv6full.h`.  Instead, it is hardcoded.  This is a problem if you happen to have, say, you are using some custom parts and have your X or Y axis motors mirrored).

In this firmware, I've made an effort to remove any instances of hard coding I come accross, as well as remove options in `1_75mm_MK3_EINSy10a-E3Dv6full.h` that either do nothing or aren't respected.  Nothing is worse than having an option and believing changing it is doing something, when in fact, it is not doing anything.  

I try to keep this relatively up-to-date with the latest development version of the firmware, but it will likely be a cautious few commits behind, as this is the firmware I use day to day on my own printer, and only push a new update that pulls in the latest Prusa changes after I know it doesn't break anything (or at least, not obviously ;)  ).


Sorry, I have to include this quick butt covering clause:

*Absolutely no support, warranty, or responability/liability is accepted by me, and being an unofficial Firmware modification, by Prusa Research.  By flashing this firmware, you accept sole responsibility for any damages, time lost, or wasted consumables that was caused by using this firmware.*


## Unofficial Nonstandard Gcodes

The primary enhancement in this Firmware are a number of new TMC stepper driver related gcodes.  Please understand that I just made these up, these gcodes are completely unofficial and are not in any spec, and never will be.  They work with this firmware and only this firmware, and if they exist at all in other firmwares, they almost certainly do something very different.  

**Note 1:** Any gcodes that change motor settings are applied immediately, so you do not need to call M910 (tmc2130_init in the stock firwmare) at all.  In fact, you don't even have to pause - all settings, even the microstepping resolution, can be changed during a print without issue.  

**Note 2:** All set gcodes double as print gcodes.  If you issue one of the set gcodes but without any arguments, it will print the current values without altering them.  Even when setting a value, it will still print the updated values afterwards to confirm the changes were applied. 


* `M910 - Handy help command that will print out all of the motor related gcodes, how to use them, and what they do.`
* `M911 [XYZE]int - Set TMC2130 holding currents.`
* `M912 [XYZE]int - Set TMC2130 running currents.`
* `M913 - Print all TMC2130 currents at once.`
* `M914 - Set normal mode.`
* `M915 - Set silent mode.`
* `M916 [XYZE]int - Set running stallguard threshold.`
* `M919 - Print all stallguard values at once.`
* `M922 [XYZE]int - Set TMC2130 homing currents.`
* `M926 [XYZE]int - Set TMC2130 homing stallguard threshold.`
* `M930 [SETB]int - Set Exturder H[S]art, H[E]ND, [T]OFF, and [B]LANKING TIME(TBL).`
* `M931 [SETB]int - Set XYZ H[S]art, H[E]ND, [T]OFF, and [B]LANKING TIME(TBL).`
* `M932 [ARTF]int - Set Exturder PWM_[A]mpl, PWM_g[R]ad, PWM_au[T]o, PWM_[F]req.`
* `M933 [XYZE]int - Set linearity correction factor for the given axis. Valid ranges: 30-200, and 0 to turn off.`
* `M350 [XYZE]int - Set microstep mode.  Valid modes: 1 (full step), 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.`
* `M361 [XYZE]1|0 - Toggle 256 microstep Interpolation. 1 = ON, 0 = OFF.`
* `M360 - Print detailed table of every single setting for every single axis.`

Expect more codes to be added in the future. 

For now, most of these settings are stored in the EEPROM so will not persist over a reset.  You'll need to change them in `1_75mm_MK3_EINSy10a-E3Dv6full.h` and recompile to permanently change them.  A safer and easier alternative would be to add them to the start gcode in your favorite slicer program.  
The one exception is axis microstepping mode - this can be saved to or recalled from the EEPROM using the standard M50x gcodes.  

Not saving these settings serves two important purposes:  you can easily return to a known good configuration after a reset, and to make sure that one can flash the stock firmware back to the printer without needing to erase the EEPROM as well (and recalibrate everything, etc. etc.) by keeping the EEPROM code identical to the stock firmware. 

## Tweaks 

This is not an exhaustive list.  You can find actual areas where I have changed or added code by searching for the `[MC]` tag with your favorite text editor, IDE, or directly on Github.
Also, I have a heavily modified printer, so for my convenience, there is a #define MC_CUSTOM flag that tweaks a few settings for my printer.  You should probably leave this turned off :).  

1. The minimum print temperature has been reduced from 15°C to 5°C.  We're all adults here, we can handle this responsibility.
2. Boot warning message disabled ;) (who has time for that?).
3. `INVERT<X,Y,Z,E>_AXIS_DIR` settings are respected during XYZ Calibration.
4. `1_75mm_MK3_EINSy10a-E3Dv6full.h` has been reworked in some sections to make it easier to customize various aspects and explain what more things actually do.  Also, some deadweight (code that has no effect) has been removed.  New options have been addded:
  * `#define SKELESTRUDER_4_to_1` - Enables support to the 4:1 gearing verison of the Skelestruder
  * 
  * Completely rewritten TMC config section:

## Tweaks/Features planned 
### (to be finished sometime between now and the heat death of the universe)

1. Spread-spectrum bed leveling (should more gracefully average out any error due to mechanical resonances) 
2. Support for MK3S
3. CLI macOS build system
